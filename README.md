# Analog-clock
Project Overview
This project is a simple Analog Clock created using [insert your programming language/technology here, e.g., HTML, CSS, and JavaScript]. The clock displays the current time in an analog format, with hour, minute, and second hands rotating to reflect the current time. The goal of this project is to provide a functional, real-time visual representation of an analog clock.

Features
Real-time update of the clock.
Dynamic movement of the hour, minute, and second hands.
Fully responsive design that adjusts to various screen sizes (if applicable).
[Optional] Customizable clock face (colors, fonts, etc.).
How It Works
The Analog Clock is designed to function based on the system's real-time clock. It calculates the degree of rotation for each hand (hour, minute, and second) and updates them continuously to represent the current time.

Hour Hand: Moves in 30-degree increments (360 degrees / 12 hours) with additional movement based on the minutes passed.
Minute Hand: Moves in 6-degree increments (360 degrees / 60 minutes) and updates based on the current seconds.
Second Hand: Moves in 6-degree increments (360 degrees / 60 seconds).
